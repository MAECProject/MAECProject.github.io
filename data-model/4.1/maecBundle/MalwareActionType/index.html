<p class="data-model-description">The <a href='/data-model/4.1/maecBundle/MalwareActionType'>MalwareActionType</a> is one of the foundational MAEC types, and serves as a method for the characterization of actions found or observed in malware. Actions can be thought of as system state changes and similar operations that represent the fundamental low-level operation of malware. Some examples include the creation of a file, deletion of a registry key, and the sending of some  data on a socket. It imports and extends the CybOX ActionType. For MAEC, the id attribute is required.</p>
