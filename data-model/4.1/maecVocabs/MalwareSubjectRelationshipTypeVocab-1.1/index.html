<p class="data-model-description">The MalwareSubjectRelationshipTypeVocab is the default MAEC vocabulary for the Malware Subject relationships in a Package, captured via the MalwareSubjectRelationshipType/Type element in the MAEC Package.
Starting with MAEC 4.1, this vocabulary should be used in place of the deprecated <a href='/data-model/4.1/maecVocabs/MalwareSubjectRelationshipTypeVocab-1.0'>MalwareSubjectRelationshipTypeVocab-1.0</a>.</p>
