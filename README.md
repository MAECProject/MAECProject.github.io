# MAEC Documentation

This is the MAEC documentation source code repository. Note: this is not the MAEC documentation meant for users! If you're looking to browse the MAEC documentation, please visit the [getting started page](https://github.com/MAECProject/schemas/wiki/Getting-Started).

**Work in progress:** The MAEC documentation is a work in progress and will be available shortly. For the time being, please see the above getting started documentation.

## Installation

1. Install Ruby 1.9.3 or higher for your platform (if it isn't already installed).
1. Install the bundler gem: `gem install bundler`
1. Install the dependencies via bundler: `bundle install`
1. Run the server with `jekyll server` or a static build with `jekyll build`

Note: Jekyll has some "issues" on Windows. See: [Jekyll on Windows](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/#installation) for instructions. The issues I encountered (other than those covered in those instructions) were:
* You'll need to install jekyll version 1.4.2:

```
gem uninstall jekyll # If you already installed it
gem install jekyll --version "=1.4.2"
```

* You'll need to install pygments version 0.5.0:

```
gem uninstall pygments.rb
gem install pygments.rb --version "=0.5.0"
```

If you run into any problems on other platforms, see the [Jekyll Installation Docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). In particular, you'll need to be able to compile native code so on OS X you'll need the Xcode Command Line tools and on Linux you'll need the appropriate build packages (build-essential on Ubuntu, etc). As with most other MAEC projects, you'll also need the libxml development libraries installed.
