This Idiom describes describes the process of characterizing multiple malware instances and the relationships between them, which can be useful for capturing multi-partite malware or malware that belongs to the same family, for instance.

## Scenario

In this scenario, we execute a particular malware instance "m1" and observe that it functions as dropper; in turn, the malware instance that it drops, "m2", functions as a downloader and downloads two additional malware instances "m3" and "m4". Thus, we wish to capture the identities of these malware instances along with the relationships between them.

## Data model
As with many of the other Idioms, the first step is to create a [MAEC Package](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/maecPackage/PackageType) with a [Malware Subject](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/maecPackage/MalwareSubjectType) for each of the malware instances that are being captured. Thus, we would create a Malware Subject for each of the four malware instances ("m1", "m2, "m3", and "m4") that were observed  The information on this process is not covered in this idiom, but can be found in the corresponding [Creating a MAEC Package](../package_creation) idiom.

With each of the [Malware Subjects](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/maecPackage/MalwareSubjectType) created, the next step is to capture the relationships between them. Let's start with the relationship between the first malware instance ("m1") and the instance that it drops ("m2"):
 
1. The first step in this process is to look in MAEC's vocabularies and find the relationship that captures the fact that "m1" drops "m2", and also its inverse, due to the fact that relationships are defined separately on each [Malware Subject](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/maecPackage/MalwareSubjectType). Thus, looking at the [Malware Subject Relationship Vocabulary](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/maecVocabs/MalwareSubjectRelationshipTypeVocab-1.1), we see that it contains the entries of "drops" and also its inverse, "dropped by", which correspond to the exact relationships that we wish to capture. 
2. With the relationship values defined, the next step is to add them to their respective [Malware Subjects](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/maecPackage/MalwareSubjectType). Thus, we first need to add a relationship to "m1" for describing the fact that it drops "m2". This is done by adding the [Relationships](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/maecPackage/MalwareSubjectRelationshipListType) list-type field to the [Malware Subject](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/maecPackage/MalwareSubjectType) that characterizes "m1". Inside of this [Relationships](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/maecPackage/MalwareSubjectRelationshipListType) field, we'll add a single [Relationship](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/maecPackage/MalwareSubjectRelationshipType) entry for capturing the relationship itself. 
3. With the [Relationship](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/maecPackage/MalwareSubjectRelationshipType) field added, there are two fields inside of it that we need to set - [Type](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/cyboxCommon/ControlledVocabularyStringType/) and [Malware_Subject_Reference](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/maecPackage/MalwareSubjectReferenceType/).  The [Type](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/cyboxCommon/ControlledVocabularyStringType/) field simply captures the nature of the relationship that we're conveying, so we'll set it to a value of "drops" and set its @xsi:type attribute to a value of "MalwareSubjectRelationshipTypeVocab-1.1" to indicate that we're using the Malware Subject Relationship Vocabulary. Finally, we'll set the @malware_subject_idref attribute in the [Malware_Subject_Reference](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/maecPackage/MalwareSubjectReferenceType/) field to the ID of the Malware Subject that the relationship points to, so in this case the ID of the Malware Subject that characterizes "m2". 
4. Now that we've added the relationship for capturing the "drops" relationship between "m1" and "m2" (i.e., "m1" -> "m2"), we need to add the inverse "dropped by" relationship ("m2" -> "m1") to "m2". This can be accomplished by repeating steps 2-3 for "m2" and the relationship value of "dropped by".

Adding the relationships between "m2" and "m3" as well as "m2" and "m4" can be accomplished in much the same manner. In these cases, the only difference besides the different [Malware Subjects](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/maecPackage/MalwareSubjectType) that the relationships will be added to is that the relationship value and its inverse will be "downloads" and "downloaded by", respectively.

Besides directional relationships between individual [Malware Subjects](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/maecPackage/MalwareSubjectType), MAEC also supports capturing a more general, grouping relationship that relates all of the [Malware Subjects](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/maecPackage/MalwareSubjectType) in a [Package](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/maecPackage/PackageType). This can be achieved via use of the [Grouping_Relationships](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/maecPackage/GroupingRelationshipListType) field on the [Package](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/maecPackage/PackageType), which is a list type that can capture multiple [Grouping Relationship](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/maecPackage/GroupingRelationshipType/) entities. Each [Grouping Relationship](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/maecPackage/GroupingRelationshipType/) includes a  [Type](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/cyboxCommon/ControlledVocabularyStringType/) field for capturing the nature of the grouping relationship, along with other fields for capturing details of specific types of grouping relationships.

In the case of this example scenario, we can use a grouping relationship to describe the broader relationship between the malware instances that we're characterizing. Specifically, since these malware instances were all seen together during the analysis, we can use the "observed together" relationship from the [Grouping Relationship Vocabulary](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/maecVocabs/GroupingRelationshipTypeVocab-1.0/) to state this fact. Thus, we'll add a [Grouping Relationship](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/maecPackage/GroupingRelationshipType/) instance to the [Grouping_Relationships](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/maecPackage/GroupingRelationshipListType) field at the root level of the [Package](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/maecPackage/PackageType). Inside this instance, the  [Type](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/cyboxCommon/ControlledVocabularyStringType/) field captures the nature of the grouping relationship that we're conveying, so we'll set it to a value of "observed together" and set its @xsi:type attribute to a value of "GroupingRelationshipTypeVocab-1.0" to indicate that we're using the Malware Grouping Relationship Vocabulary.
