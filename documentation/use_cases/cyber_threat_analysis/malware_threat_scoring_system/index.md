title: Malware Threat Scoring System

---

The linkage between MAEC and other standards efforts &mdash; for example, [Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX™)](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/) &mdash; could allow for the creation of a malware threat scoring system, similar to that of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)](https://www.first.org/cvss/) for software vulnerabilities. 

MAEC’s link to relevant standards, as well as its characterization of mid and high-level malware features, can provide the necessary data for accurately describing the attack vectors and payload of a malware instance. This data could then be used to score the potential impact of the malware based on pre-defined categories, such as payload type (e.g., data theft, bot-like behavior, etc.) and degree of persistence.
