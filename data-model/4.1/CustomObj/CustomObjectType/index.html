<p class="data-model-description">The <a href='/data-model/4.1/CustomObj/CustomObjectType'>CustomObjectType</a> is intended to characterize objects that are not described by other defined CybOX Object schemas. Objects of this type have no pre-defined properties but instead all properties are provided by the author using the inherited Custom_Properties field.</p>

          <p>The object_reference field specifies a unique ID reference to an Object defined elsewhere. This construct allows for the re-use of the defined Properties of one Object within another, without the need to embed the full Object in the location from which it is being referenced. Thus, this ID reference is intended to resolve to the Properties of the Object that it points to.</p>

          <p>The custom_name field specifies a name for this for this type of Custom Object. The custom_name field should use the same namespace as used in the Object and Observable id fields for this author. Two Objects should only have the same custom_name value if they are written by the same author (i.e., their namespace is the same) and they are characterizing the same type of Object. Note that this does not necessarily mean that two such Object instances will both have identical properties in every case.</p>
