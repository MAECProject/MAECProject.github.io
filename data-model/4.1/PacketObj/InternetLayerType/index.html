<p class="data-model-description">The Internet layer is the group of methods, protocols, and specifications that are used to transport packets from the originating host across network boundaries. Not all protocols are currently defined, just those most commonly used: IPv4, ICMPv4, IPv6, ICMPv6. Other protocols will be added as needed. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_layer).</p>
