title: Malware Repositories

---



There is typically disparity among the malware repository schemas currently in use by different organizations, with essentially every security organization using their own custom schema.  This makes effective sharing of analysis information difficult, even if both parties want to share analyses and other data.  

MAEC provides a solution.  As discussed previously, the MAEC schema is well-suited to be used as a common, standardized, intermediate format for mapping between dissimilar malware repository schemas so that analysis information stored in disparate repositories can be shared.
