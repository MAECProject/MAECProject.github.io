          <p>The reason for Flow termination. It may contain SiLK-specific tags. The range of values may include the following: 0x01: idle timeout (the Flow was terminated because it was considered to be idle). 0x02: active timeout (the Flow was terminated for reporting purposes while it was still active, for example, after the maximum lifetime of unreported Flows was reached). 0x03: end of Flow detected (the Flow was terminated because the Metering Process detected signals indicating the end of the Flow, for example, the TCP FIN flag.) 0x04: forced end (the Flow was terminated because of some external event, for example, a shutdown of the Metering Process initiated by a network management application.) 0x05: lack of resources (the Flow was terminated because of lack of resources available to the Metering Process and/or the Exporting Process.) See http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipfix/ipfix.xml for more information.</p>

For example, traffic that the flow generator recognizes as FTP will have a value of 21, even if that traffic is being routed through the standard HTTP/web port (80).</p>

          <p>Shannon Entropy calculation of the forward payload data. The calculation generates a real number value between 0.0 and 8.0. That number is then converted into an 8-bit integer value between 0 and 255. Roughly, numbers above 230 are generally compressed (or encrypted) and numbers centered around approximately 140 are English text. Lower numbers carry even less information content.</p>
