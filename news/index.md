## MAEC Version 5.0 Specifications Now Available in Slate

The relevant portions of the [MAEC 5.0 Specifications](http://maecproject.github.io/releases/5.0/#specifications) have been ported into the [Slate API](https://github.com/lord/slate) document generator and are now available at: [http://maecproject.github.io/documentation/maec5-docs/](http://maecproject.github.io/documentation/maec5-docs/).

This new section of the MAEC website presents key concepts from the MAEC 5.0 Core Concepts and Vocabularies specifications in an easy-to-read format, and is searchable. And while this version of the specifications in Slate is not meant to supplant the [complete versions of the specifications](http://maecproject.github.io/releases/5.0/#specifications), it will hopefully be a useful reference for [MAEC 5.0](http://maecproject.github.io/releases/5.0/).

Please check out the [new section of the MAEC website](http://maecproject.github.io/documentation/maec5-docs/) and let us know what you think on the [MAEC Community Email Discussion List](/community/#discussion-lists--archives), or directly to [maec@mitre.org](mailto:maec@mitre.org).

## MAEC Website Updated for MAEC Version 5.0

The MAEC website has been fully updated for [MAEC Version 5.0](/releases/5.0/), with new or revised content in the [Getting Started](http://maecproject.github.io/getting-started/), [Releases](http://maecproject.github.io/releases/5.0/), [Documentation](http://maecproject.github.io/documentation/), and [About MAEC](http://maecproject.github.io/about-maec/) sections. 

Please check out the updated sections and let us know what you think on the [MAEC Community Email Discussion List](/community/#discussion-lists--archives), or directly to [maec@mitre.org](mailto:maec@mitre.org).

## "MAEC 5.0" Now Available!

[Malware Attribute Enumeration and Characterization (MAEC™) Version 5.0](/releases/5.0/) is now available in the [Releases](/releases/5.0/) section of the MAEC website.

The most significant changes in the MAEC 5.0 release include: a more graph-based approach through the definition of MAEC top-level objects and MAEC relationships; JSON serialization, which significantly reduces the size and complexity of MAEC documents and allows for better integration with other applications; a single standardized output format (the MAEC Package); a new object for capturing properties associated with malware families; a new type for capturing metadata about signatures and rules (e.g., YARA rules) triggered by a malware instance; and a new type for capturing details of how a malware instance is obfuscated. A complete list of changes is available in Section 1.2 of the [MAEC 5.0 "Core" Specification](/releases/5.0/#specifications).

MAEC 5.0 includes the following:     

* [MAEC 5.0 "Core" Specification](/releases/5.0/#specifications)
* [MAEC 5.0 "Vocabularies" Specification](/releases/5.0/#specifications)
* A full set of [JSON schemas](/releases/5.0/#json-schemas) that correspond with the specifications
* A [Cuckoo Sandbox 2.x reporting module](/releases/5.0/#cuckoo-reporting-modules) that produces native MAEC 5.0 output     

Feedback or questions about this release are welcome on the [MAEC Community Email Discussion List](/community/#discussion-lists--archives), or directly to [maec@mitre.org](mailto:maec@mitre.org).    

## "MAEC 5.0 (Draft)" Released for Community Review & Comment

[MAEC 5.0 (Draft)](/releases/5.0/) is now available for community review and comment. All comments are **due by September 29, 2017**.

MAEC 5.0 (Draft) includes the following:     

* [MAEC 5.0 (Draft) "Core" Specification](/releases/5.0/#specifications)
* [MAEC 5.0 (Draft) "Vocabularies" Specification](/releases/5.0/#specifications)
* A full set of [JSON schemas](/releases/5.0/#json-schemas) that correspond with the specifications
* A [Cuckoo Sandbox 2.x reporting module](/releases/5.0/#cuckoo-reporting-modules) that produces native MAEC 5.0 output     

We are particularly interested in hearing about anything that might be confusing or under-specified in the specifications.

Feedback is welcome on the [MAEC Community Email Discussion List](/community/#discussion-lists--archives), or directly to [maec@mitre.org](mailto:maec@mitre.org).
