It indicates the offset of the program's compiled/assembled and linked image (the load module) within the executable file. The size of the load module can be deduced by subtracting this value (converted to bytes) from the overall file size derived from combining the e_cp (number of file pages) and e_cblp (number of bytes in last page) values.

This value must be used to locate the relocation pointer table (rather than assuming a fixed location) because variable-length information pertaining to program overlays can occur before this table, causing its position to vary. A value of 0x40 in this field generally indicates a different kind of executable file, not a DOS 'MZ' type.</p>
