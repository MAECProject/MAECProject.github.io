Beginning Wednesday, September 28, 2016, the MAEC Team will be hosting the first of a series of 1-hour, bi-weekly, working session calls for [MAEC Version 5.0](http://maecproject.github.io/documentation/roadmap/). 

Each bi-weekly call will focus on a particular topic. However, we very much welcome suggestions from our community, so please [let us know](maec@mitre.org) what youâ€™d like to discuss for any meeting. Anything MAEC-related is relevant!
