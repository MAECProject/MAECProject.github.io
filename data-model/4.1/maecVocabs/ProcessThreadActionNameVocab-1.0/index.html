<p class="data-model-description">The ProcessThreadActionNameVocab is the default MAEC vocabulary for process thread action names, captured via the ActionType/Name element in CybOX Core.
For process thread action names, it should be used in place of the CybOX <a href='/data-model/4.1/stixVocabs/ActionNameVocab-1.0'>ActionNameVocab-1.0</a>.</p>
