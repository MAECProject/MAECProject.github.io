# Malware Behavior Catalog Matrix #
The [Malware Behavior Catalog (MBC)](https://github.com/MBCProject/mbc-markdown) is a catalog of malware Objectives and Behaviors.

### Objectives (Columns) ###
Malware Objectives are based on [ATT&CK Tactics](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/enterprise/), tailored for the malware analysis use case. Two malware analysis-specific Objectives (Anti-Behavioral Analysis and Anti-Static Analysis) are also defined. 

### Behaviors (Rows) ###
Under each Objective, the MBC captures all Behaviors and code characteristics discovered during malware analysis. Malware Behaviors draw from [ATT&CK Techniques](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/enterprise/) when possible. Details are available in [MBC](https://github.com/MBCProject/mbc-markdown).
