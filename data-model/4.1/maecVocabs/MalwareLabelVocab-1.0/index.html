    <tr>
      <td>clicker</td>
      <td>The 'clicker' value specifies a trojan that makes a system visit a specific web page, often very frequently and usually with the aim of increasing the traffic recorded by the site and thus increasing revenue from advertising. Clickers may also be used to carry out DDoS attacks.</td>

      <td>The 'rogue anti-malware' value specifies a fake security product that demands money to clean phony infections.</td>
    </tr>
  
    <tr>
      <td>rootkit</td>
      <td>The 'rootkit' value generally refers to a method of hiding files or processes from normal methods of monitoring, and is often used by malware to conceal its presence and activities. Originally, the term applied to UNIX-based operating systems - a root kit was a collection of tools to enable a user to obtain root (administrator-level) access to a system and conceal any changes they might make. Such tools often included trojanized versions of standard monitoring software which would hide the root kit operators' activities. More recently the term has generally been applied to malware using stealth techniques. Rootkits can operate at a number of levels, from the application level - simply replacing or adjusting the settings of system software to prevent the display of certain information - through hooking certain functions or inserting modules or drivers into the operating system kernel, to the deeper level of firmware or virtualization rook kits, which are activated before the operating system and thus even harder to detect while the system is running.</td>
    </tr>
  
    <tr>
      <td>shellcode</td>
      <td>The 'shellcode' value specifies 1. A small piece of code that activates a command-line interface to a system that can be used to disable security measures, open a backdoor, or download further malicious code. 2.

    <tr>
      <td>spyware</td>
      <td>The 'spyware' value specifies software that gathers information and passes it to a third-party without adequate permission from the owner of the data. It may also be used in a wider sense, to include software that makes changes to a system or any of its component software, or which makes use of system resources without the full understanding and consent of the system owner.</td>
    </tr>
  
    <tr>
      <td>trojan horse</td>
      <td>The 'trojan horse' value specifies a piece of malicious code disguised as something inert or benign.</td>
    </tr>
  
    <tr>
      <td>variant</td>
      <td>The 'variant' value refers to the fact that types of malware can be subdivided into a number of families, or groups sharing many similarities, generally based on the same blocks of code and sharing similar behaviours. Within a family, a variant signifies a single individual item that is uniquely different from other members of the same family.</td>

    </tr>
  
    <tr>
      <td>zip bomb</td>
      <td>The 'zip bomb' value specifies a file compressed into some archive format and that expands to an enormous size when uncompressed, often by looping over the extraction code until the system's resources are exhausted.</td>
