       Relationships are used to express relationships between objects, and dates. Relationships have 
       a type (an attribute with a defined list of allowed relationships), source (a set of xpath references to the parent end of 
       the relationship), target (xpath references to the other end of the relationship) and an optional date.
       
       The linking of objects with types is a powerful way of describing data. The dates can be used to provide context. 
       
       For example, to assign a classification to an object, that can done with an "isClassifiedAs" relationship, with the date meaning 
       that that was the data that that classification was assigned.
       
       To show urls and the last visited data, this can be expressed as a "verifiedBy" relationship between the urls and the entity doing the 
       verification, with the date interpreted as the verification date.
