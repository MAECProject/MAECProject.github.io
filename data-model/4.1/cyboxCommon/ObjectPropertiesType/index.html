<p class="data-model-description">The <a href='/data-model/4.1/cyboxCommon/ObjectPropertiesType'>ObjectPropertiesType</a> is an Abstract type placeholder within the CybOX schema enabling the inclusion of contextually varying object properties descriptions. This Abstract type is leveraged as the extension base for all predefined CybOX object properties schemas. Through this extension mechanism any object instance data based on an object properties schema extended from <a href='/data-model/4.1/cyboxCommon/ObjectPropertiesType'>ObjectPropertiesType</a> (e.g. File_Object, Address_Object, etc.) can be directly integrated into any instance document where a field is defined as ObjectPropertiesType. For flexibility and extensibility purposes any user of CybOX can specify their own externally defined object properties schemas (outside of or derived from the set of predefined objects) extended from <a href='/data-model/4.1/cyboxCommon/ObjectPropertiesType'>ObjectPropertiesType</a> and utilize them as part of their CybOX content.</p>

          <p>The object_reference field specifies a unique ID reference to an Object defined elsewhere. This construct allows for the re-use of the defined Properties of one Object within another, without the need to embed the full Object in the location from which it is being referenced. Thus, this ID reference is intended to resolve to the Properties of the Object that it points to.</p>
