title: Malware Visualization---

In addition to capturing the output of one or more malware analyses, a MAEC Package or 
MAEC Bundle can also be used as a standard format to create visualizations of malware 
behavior. Such visualizations permit clear assessment of the low-level Actions, mid-level 
Behaviors, and high-level Capabilities performed by malware and facilitate comparison 
between two or more malware instances. 

While no visualization tools currently exist to display MAEC content, we expect that future
tools will provide much needed insight to analysts for quickly identifying similarities 
between malware instances and between analysis outputs from different tools.
