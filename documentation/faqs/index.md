## General

### What is MAEC?

Malware Attribute Enumeration and Characterization (MAECâ„¢) is a structured language for encoding and communicating high fidelity information about malware based upon attributes such as behaviors, artifacts, and attack patterns.

### How is "MAEC" pronounced?

MAEC is pronounced as "mike." This pronunciation stems from classical Latin, in which the diphthong 'ae' is pronounced as a long 'i'. Examples of other words that use the same pronunciation are maestro and alumnae.

### Is a specification available for the MAEC Language?

Both PDF and Word versions of the current [MAEC Language Specifications](https://github.com/MAECProject/specifications/documents) are available.

### Where can I find examples of what I can capture and do with MAEC?

Examples can be found in the [MAEC Schemas MAECProject repository](https://github.com/MAECProject/schemas/tree/master/examples) on GitHub.com.

### Why was MAEC developed?

MAEC was developed to eliminate the ambiguity and inaccuracy that currently exists in malware descriptions. By reducing reliance on signatures, MAEC aims to improve human-to-tool, tool-to-tool, and tool-to-human communication about malware; allow for faster development of countermeasures by enabling the ability to leverage responses to previously observed malware instances; and reduce potential duplication of malware analysis efforts by researchers.

### How was MAEC developed?

MAEC is a community-developed effort and has received input from members of various communities, including those from industry, academia, and government. [The MITRE Corporation](http://www.mitre.org/) maintains MAEC and its public website presence and provides impartial technical guidance to the [MAEC Community]() throughout the process to ensure MAEC serves the public interest. MAEC is sponsored by the office of [Cybersecurity and Communications](http://www.dhs.gov/office-cybersecurity-and-communications/) at the [U.S. Department of Homeland Security](http://www.dhs.gov/).

### Where can I get MAEC?

The current MAEC schema, as well as example files, schematron rules, and related documentation, are available in the [MAEC Schemas in the MAECProject repository](https://github.com/MAECProject/schemas) on GitHub.com.

### Is MAEC a formal standard?

MAEC is not currently being pursued in a formal standards body. However, once an appropriate level of maturity, stability, and use is achieved, international standardization will be sought.

### How is MAEC licensed?

See the "[License]()" section of the [Terms of Use]().
