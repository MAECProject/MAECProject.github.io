          <p>A destination unreachable message is an ICMP message which is generated by the host or its inbound gateway to inform the client that the destination is unreachable for some reason (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICMP_Destination_Unreachable).</p>

          <p>A source quench message is an ICMP message that requests that the sender decrease the rate of messages sent to a router or host. This message may be generated if a router or host does not have sufficient buffer space to process the request or may occur if the router or host buffer is approaching its limit (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICMP_Source_Quench).</p>

          <p>An ICMP time exceeded message is generated by a gateway to inform the source of a datagram that the datagram has been discarded due to the time to live field reaching zero. A time exceeded message may also be sent by a host if it fails to reassemble a fragmented datagram within its time limit (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICMP_Time_Exceeded).</p>
