title: Malware Threat Scoring System

---



The linkage between MAEC and other standards efforts allows for the creation of a malware threat scoring system, similar to that of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) for software vulnerabilities. MAEC's link to relevant standards, as well as its characterization of mid and high-level malware features, provided the necessary data for accurately describing the attack vectors and payload of a malware instance.  This data could be used to score the potential impact of the malware based on pre-defined categories, such as payload type (e.g., data theft, bot-like behavior, etc.) and degree of entrenchment/propagation, for example.
