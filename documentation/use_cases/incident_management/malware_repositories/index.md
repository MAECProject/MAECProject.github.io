title: Malware Repositories

---

Typically, there is disparity among the malware repository schemas used by different organizations, with essentially every security organization using a custom schema. This makes effective sharing of analysis information difficult, even if both parties want to share analyses and other data. 

MAEC provides a solution: the MAEC schema is well-suited to be used as a common, standardized, intermediate format for mapping between dissimilar malware repository schemas so that analysis information stored in disparate repositories can be shared.
