### Mailing List Subscription Information

MITRE performs due diligence to ensure that subscription information is kept confidential. In addition, all MAEC-related mailing lists that are sponsored by MITRE are configured to prevent attackers from identifying the subscribers to such mailing lists.

Optional information that subscribers may provide, such as company name, location, or job function, is used to determine broad demographic information regarding the types of users of these mailing lists. Subscribers are not required to provide this information.

### Provision of Information to Third Parties

MITRE will not provide any information that identifies specific individuals to any other organization, except where required by law. MITRE may provide broad demographic information to other organizations.
