<p class="data-model-description">The SocketActionNameVocab is the default MAEC vocabulary for socket action names, captured via the ActionType/Name element in CybOX Core.
For socket action names, it should be used in place of the CybOX <a href='/data-model/4.1/maecVocabs/ActionNameVocab-1.0'>ActionNameVocab-1.0</a>.</p>

If this field is set to ANY, then a pattern is considered to be matched if the provided condition successfully evaluates for any of the values in the field body. If the field is set to ALL, then the patern only matches if the provided condition successfully evaluates for every value in the field body.</p>
